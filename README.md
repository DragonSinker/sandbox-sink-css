# SINK CSS

WTF is this?

First, it's an experiment.
Second - it is an answer to a question I started asking myself after
I noticed some websites serving up more than a megabyte of css.

"How big is the entire css language? I mean the ENTIRE thing. Is it bigger or smaller than 1MB?"

So this is the entire css language - put into single purpose classes at multiple breakpoints.
For properties that take integers as values instead of strings i.e margin and padding - I have
created a 10 step scale. Which is more verbose than I need - but figured I'd air on the side
of making this as big as possible. Turns out all of css * 4 isn't all that big.

* 17kb total (minified and gzipped)
